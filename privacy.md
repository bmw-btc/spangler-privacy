No data is shared with third parties. No marketing messages are sent. No user data is sold, rented, or distributed.

## Message Content

Messages consist of automated system status updates, daily productivity briefings, escalation alerts, and health monitoring notifications. All messages are purely informational and operational.

## Opt-Out

The sole recipient may stop receiving messages at any time by replying STOP or by removing their phone number from the system configuration.
